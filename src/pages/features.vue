                                and quickly learnable without assistance. In order to handle multiple images easily,
                                Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the
                                image instead of a text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast.</p>

                                    Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Starting the app is nearly
                                    instantaneous and every feature has been thoroughly optimized to take advantage of
                                    the latest multicore CPUs, GPUs, and NVMe SSDs. Whether you have a power-conscious
                                    laptop or a monstrous desktop with a gigantic GPU, you can expect Paint.NET to start
                                    up immediately, respond quickly to every mouse click, and take full advantage of all
                                    of your hardware.

                                    layers form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them
                                    as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form
                                    one image.</p>

                            Gradient tool has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by
                            other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet
                            still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for
                            selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of
                            an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, a Recolor tool, and an
                            extensible Shapes tool, among others.<br></p>
